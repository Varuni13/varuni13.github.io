# Welcome to My Website

Hi, I'm **Varuni Singh**, a postgraduate student in the *eMasters in Data Science for Decision Making* program at **IIT Gandhinagar**.

This is my personal space where I document what I learn, build, and present — blending academic insights with practical implementations.  
From cutting-edge AI techniques to optimization, NLP, and system design, I believe in learning by doing and sharing knowledge openly.
